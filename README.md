# About

Re-adds the Hive 1 and 2 namelists from Stellaris 3.6: Autonomous Drone, Motile Organ, etc.

**Also**: Adds a generic ship name for anything not covered by the specific names.


# Compatibility

Does not conflict with vanilla (aka: does not replace the 3.7 Hive name lists, but adds 2 more).

**NOT** achievement compatible (sorry, not my fault).

Load order does not matter.

This mod is only localized in **English** because other languages were not changed in 3.7 e.g. German is still "Autonome Drohne 1".
